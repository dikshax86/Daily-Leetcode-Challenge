# Bipartite Graph Checker

This code provides a solution to check if a given graph is bipartite. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to assign colors to nodes and checks for any conflicts in the coloring scheme.

## How to Run

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

2. Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., `bipartite_checker.py`).

3. Save the file and navigate to the directory where it is located.

4. Open a command-line interface or terminal in that directory.

5. Run the Python file using the following command:

   ```shell
   python bipartite_checker.py
